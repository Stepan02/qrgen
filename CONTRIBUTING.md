### üçé Safari browser
The extension is yet to be tested in Safari browser. I am currently unable to test the extension since I lack Apple device.
If you are able to test the extension in Safari and would like to contribute to this project, please create an issue by clicking this [link](https://github.com/stepan02/qrgen/issues/new?title=Safari+browser+test) or manually with ***Safari browser test*** title.
